				<h2 class="heading">Holistic</h2>
				<p>Rather than breaking design into specializations like research, interaction, or visual design, Artificial Design takes a holistic approach that blends disciplines through the creative process. By considering "how it works" and "how it feels" simultaneously, the experience design stays in harmony.</p>
				<h2 class="heading">Generative & Reductive</h2>
				<p>The Artificial Design process seeks to explore possible solutions, gather input, and synthesize to the best option or options. This process repeats at large and small scales until a product is shipped, and then repeats.</p>

				<h2 class="heading">Integrated</h2>
				<p>It can be a challenge to mesh design processes with lean businesses, agile software teams, or careful risk-reducing large-scale bureaucracies. I enjoy taking on these challenges to show how design can contribute to everyone's success.</p>
				<h2 class="heading">Project-Focused</h2>
				<p>To really design a system with purpose, a level of obsession is needed. Working for only a few hours and then shifting context to another project or a meeting costs much more than time spent. I focus on one product each day so that I can collect my thoughts while biking to work, eating lunch, or enjoying a dark &amp; stormy.</p>
