				<p>To better understand the needs of our users, we immersed ourselves in the experience of setting up and riding a VanMoof through the city. This helped us to identify pain points that we could improve through the app’s redesign.</p>
				<p>We then determined a handful of features we might want to add to the existing experience. We explored these additions as well as the interaction model and visual design through a series of design gestures.</p>
