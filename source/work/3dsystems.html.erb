				<p>3D Systems not only wanted to introduce new users to 3D printing, they also wanted to establish themselves as forerunners in the field to anyone who was familiar with the process. To do this, we highlighted the moments of the experience where the 3D Systems algorithms did what none of the competitors could.</p>

				<p>The final solution was a minimal and flat interface, providing contrast to the 3D objects being manipulated within. Each app's functionality was limited to provide the user with clear purpose. Every control and icon was carefully crafted to work across interfaces, ranging from scanning to printing and beyond.</p>
