				<p class="statement">Roader is a connected wearable camera that is always buffering but only records with the press of a button. When pressed, the device captures the past 10 seconds along with the future 10 seconds as a clip. We worked with Roader to create a delightful experience around the editing and sharing of these clips.</p>
